== Purpose

This repo accompanies my session titled *"Copilot Is My Copilot: Pair Programming with an AI"* and includes all code written within the session and potentially more.

*_Star+watch this repo for updates!_*

== Notes

* Some portions are INOP (inoperative) as they exist currently, e.g. the Terraform script. I left it this way to illustrate the current potential and limitations of Copilot Chat.
